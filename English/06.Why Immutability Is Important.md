### Why Immutablility【不变性】 Is Important?

In the previous code example, we suggested that you use the .slice() method to create a copy of the squares array to modify instead of modifying the existing array. We'll now discuss immutability and why immutability is important to learn.

There are generally two approaches to changing data. The first approach is to mutate【转变，转换】 the data by directly changing the data's value. The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the disired changes.
