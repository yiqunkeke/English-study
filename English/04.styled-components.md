## styled-components

### Motivation
styled-components is the result of wondering how we could enhance【增强】 CSS for styling React component systems.
By focusing on a single use case we managed to optimize【优化】 the experience for developers as well as the output for end users.

Apart from【除了】 the improved【改善的，改进的】 experience for developers, styled-components provides:

* **Automatic critical CSS**:【自动、关键的CSS】 styled-components keeps track of which components are rendered on a page and injects their styles and nothing else, fully automatically. Combined with code splitting, this means your users load the least amount of code necessary.

* **No class name bugs**: styled-components generates【生成】 unique class names for your styles. You never have to worry about duplication【重复】, overlap【重叠，覆盖】 or misspellings【拼写错误】.

* **Easier deletion of CSS**: it can be hard to know whether a class name is used somewhere in you codebase. styled-components makes it obvious, as every bit of styling is tied to a specfic component. If the component is unused(which tooling can detect) and gets deleted, all its styles get deleted with it.

* **Simple dynamic styling**: adapting【调整】 the styling of a component based on【根据】 its props or a global theme is simple and intuitive【直观】without having to【无需】 manually【手动地】 manage【管理】 dozens of【几十、很多】 classes.

* **Painless maintennace**: you never have to hunt across different files to find the styling affecting your component, so maintenance is a piece of cake no matter how big your codebase is.
【您永远不必在不同的文件中搜索影响组件的样式，因此无论代码库有多大，维护都是小菜一碟。】

* **Automatic vendor prefixing**【自动供应商前缀】: write your CSS to the current standard【当前标准】 and let styled-components handle the rest. You get all of these benefits while still writing the CSS you know and love, just bound to individual components.
【将CSS编写成当前的标准，让样式化的组件处理其余部分。你可以在编写你所熟悉和喜爱的CSS的同时获得所有这些好处，只需绑定到各个组件。】

### Installation
Installing styled-components only takes a single command and you're ready to roll:

``` js
npm install --save styled-components
```
If you use a package manager like yarn that supports the "resolutions" package.json field, we also highly recommend 【强烈建议】you add an entry to it as well corresponding to【对应】the major version range【主版本范围】. This helps avoid an entire class of problems that arise from【产生于，起因于】 multiple versions of styled-components being installed in your project.

#### NOTE
It's highly recommended to also use the Babel plugin. It offers many benefits like more legible【清晰的】 class names, server-side rendering compatibility, smaller bundles, and more.

### Getting Started

styled-components utilises【使用】 tagged template literals【标记模板文本】 to style your components.

It removes the mapping between components and styles【它删除组件和样式之间的映射。】. This means that when you're defining your styles, you're actually creating a normal React component, that has your styles attached to it.
【这意味着在定义样式时，实际上是在创建一个普通的React组件，该组件附加了您的样式】

This example creates two simple components, a wrapper and a title, with some styles attached to it :

```js
    // style.js 文件：
    import styled from 'styled-components'

    // Create a Title Component that'll render an <h1> tag with some styles
    export const Title = styled.h1`
        font-size: 1.5em;
        text-align: center;
        color: palevioletred;
    `
    // Create a Wrapper component that'll render a <section> tag with some styles
    export const Wrapper = styled.section`
        padding: 4em;
        background: papayawhip;
    `
```

```js
    //index.js入口文件： 
    import { Wrapper, Title } from './style.js'
    // Use Title and Wrapper like any other React component - except they're styled! 
    render(
        <Wrapper>
            <Title>
                Hello world!
            </Title>
        </Wrapper>
    )
```

#### NOTE
The CSS rules are automatically vendor prefixed, styled-components takes care of that for you!
【CSS规则是自动添加供应商前缀的，styled-components会为您处理这些问题！】
